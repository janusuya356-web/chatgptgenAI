You're right that we carry a TechPro Ultrabook priced at $800, but comparing the BlueWave Chromebook and TechPro Desktop straight up isn't quite simple as both are different models with their own specific price points. However, I can help you compare similar categories! For example, if we consider laptops alone, then yes, a TechPro Ultrabook is more expensive than the BlueWave Chromebook by $650; however, for desktops and convertibles which are also available from us with their own distinct prices too. I hope this clarifies your query! If you're interested in any particular type of device or have other questions about our products, feel free to ask – we always love helping customers make informed decisions on technology purchases.\n"
